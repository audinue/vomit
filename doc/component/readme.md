# Components

Vomit's philosophy is that everything should be as easy as a function call. When some libraries out there encapsulate DOM elements into stateful wrapper, we believe that a simple function call is enough to create a DOM element, and an other call enough to update that element.

We made the distinction between three types of components using all the same syntax:
* [Static](/doc/component/static.md)
* [Dynamic](/doc/component/dynamic.md)
* [Web Component](/doc/component/web-components.md)


With those three types, you will be able to optimize your application by choosing which parts need to be updated. Your code will be easy to understand and predictable.
