## Installation

To run the examples locally, please type:

```shell
# latest stable
$ npm run examples
```

Those examples are generated on the fly from a markdown file. We created especially for Vomit a new way to generate live example from documentation! Please check out the examples markdown files or [vomit-markdown](https://github.com/bredele/vomit-markdown) for more information.

All tools created for vomit have been built with the vomit library, we encourage you to take a look at them and find new ways to use vomit on your projects.
